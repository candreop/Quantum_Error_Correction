# Quantum Error Correction Simulation

This repository contains code and resources for simulating quantum error-correcting codes.

## Project Structure

- `Basic 3 qubit code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the simulation code for the 3-qubit bit flip code for simple bit flip errors. The simulation is carried out using linear algebra with numpy, and the results are visualized to understand the performance of the error correction code against random bit flip errors.
